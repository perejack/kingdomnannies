## ✅ Email Functionality Setup Complete

Your application is now configured to send emails when users submit the form. Here's what's been set up:

### 📧 Email Configuration
- **Email:** gwellurah@gmail.com
- **App Password:** rdyo jcan rcih frhf
- **Recipient:** All form submissions will be sent to gwellurah@gmail.com

### 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add email functionality with Netlify functions"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Use these build settings:
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Verify Email Function**:
   - Once deployed, test the application form
   - Check that emails are received at gwellurah@gmail.com

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `netlify/functions/submit-application.js` - Serverless function for email sending

### 🔧 How It Works

1. User fills out the application form
2. Form data is sent to `/api/submit-application`
3. Netlify redirects this to `/.netlify/functions/submit-application`
4. The serverless function sends an email to gwellurah@gmail.com
5. User receives success/error feedback

### 📧 Email Format

When someone submits an application, you'll receive a professional email with:
- Applicant's full name
- Email address
- Phone number
- Position applied for (Caregiver, Housekeeper, or Cook/Chef)
- Professional HTML formatting
- CareConnect Kenya branding

### 🔒 Security Notes

- Gmail app password is securely configured
- CORS is properly set up for cross-origin requests

### 🎯 Testing

After deployment:
1. Visit your Netlify site
2. Fill out the application form
3. Submit the form
4. Check gwellurah@gmail.com for the email
5. Verify all applicant details are included

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**If emails aren't being sent:**
1. Check Netlify function logs in your dashboard
